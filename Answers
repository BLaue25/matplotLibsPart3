Sending files or code to anyone interested or certain employers.
I would choose my Gryla game because it used most of the code I learned in the class and it shows an employer that my code works and that I am able to code a working script.
So when selecting the files that you want to zip together on windows, access your File Explorer and make your way to the documents that you want to zip. Make sure that the items you want to zip are in the same location to make it more efficient and easier to access and run on a program. Next, select the documents you want to send and right click. You should see an option for 7-Zip (7-Zipping your files is a universal sharing method that allows any program to open and save the information inside the zip file) Once 7-Zip is selected, you can either zip compress email it to someone or compress the files in a zip. Choose which ever one is best for your situation. Once zipped, you can share with any program or anyone you'd like.
Open the Python Idle program. Once opened select file, new file. Then find the “Options” option and click on it. Once selected find “Show Line Numbers” and that's it.
A good habit to be in when naming variables is to follow the same pattern throughout the whole script so it is easier to find mistakes and to fix them. An example of a good variable name are: exampleOne, or example_one. (Called camel case) Examples of bad variable names are: eXaMpLeOnE, example one (space is invalid in coding),  or: thisismyexampleone (you want to keep it short and precise).
I didn’t select a major yet, but I enjoy history and science so I am looking forward to my history and science class next semester. The history class is “United States Since 1877”, the instructors name is Cory Haala and I am excited to learn more about post civil war US. The science class is “Principles of Biology I” and it is instructed by Daniel Graf. I don't really know the topics we will be discussing but I enjoy learning science.
